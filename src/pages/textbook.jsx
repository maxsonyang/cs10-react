                    You are encouraged to form study groups and work together to understand course material,

                    and ethical conduct are of utmost importance in the College of Engineering and at UC Berkeley, 
                    especially with online offerings. We want to remind you that this course is graded on an 
                    absolute scale – that means that there will be no curve at the end of the course, so you don’t 
                    have to feel the pressure of having to cheat to get your A. You’re competing against an absolute 
                    scale, and you can all (in theory) receive A+ grades! (Though, we might need to make small bin 
                    adjustments if the GPA of the class is below the department suggested range, so we might adjust 
                    your score up, but it’ll never be adjusted down).

                            Online classes taught during a time of wildfires, power outages, and a worldwide pandemic need to 
                            have policies that support students in different living situations, and in different time zones. 
                            They need to have a way that the students can get to know each other, learn from each other, and 
                            study with each other. They need to have a way the course staff can get to know their students, 
                            and (most importantly) check in with them to make sure their health and learning is going ok. The 
                            deadlines need to have flexibility in case a student or team needs some more time to finish a project 
                            or homework. We believe we have built all of that into our class this semester.

                        Research (and anecdotal evidence) have shown that students who keep up with the material every week 
                        do better than students who fall behind, start projects late, and have to cram for each exam at the 
                        last minute. So, as much as you can, attend our face-to-face live session (Mon @ 11am PST … but Wed 
                        when Monday is a holiday) + a discussion (3 different times) synchronously. However, you will not be 
                        penalized for being in a time zone that makes that difficult, and you will find recordings of these 
                        sessions available. The only required synchronous elements are a weekly 15m check-in with you and three 
                        other students with video on (with exceptions on a student-by-student basis), but will have many times 
                        throughout the day available for that, and getting your lab checked off at a lab section.

                        as early as possible. Late project submission requires approval by your TA. For each day a project 
                        is late, one-third of the total points you would have earned on the assignment will be deducted.

                        You will be granted six slip days throughout the course. A slip day allows you to extend the deadline 
                        period by one day with no penalty. For example, if you turn in an assignment due Sunday at 11:59 PM 
                        any time before Monday at 11:59 PM, you will use one slip day. It will be applied automatically, 
                        and if you use more than 6 throughout the semester, than we will apply them to the assignments in a 
                        way that maximizes your overall course grade.

                        The ideal case for using a resubmission is if you misunderstood a specification or rubric element -- here 
                        you know how to do something, but didn’t understand exactly what you were being asked to do. Another good 
                        case for resubmission is if you just couldn’t figure out how to code one block, then finally figured it out 
                        after the material had a chance to sink in.
