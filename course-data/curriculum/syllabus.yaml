# Ignore for now.

overview:
  - header: Welcome!
    body: In Spring 2021, CS10 is expanding upon last fall's teaching plan to better support students and 
          encourage participation during this unusual online offering of the course. Special thank 
          you to John DeNero and the CS61A team for writing the original document which this was based on.

  - header: Collaboration, not Competition
    body: You are encouraged to form study groups and work together to understand course material, 
          but (unless specified otherwise) all your graded work should be your own. Academic integrity 
          and ethical conduct are of utmost importance in the College of Engineering and at UC Berkeley, 
          especially with online offerings. We want to remind you that this course is graded on an 
          absolute scale – that means that there will be no curve at the end of the course, so you 
          don’t have to feel the pressure of having to cheat to get your A. You’re competing against 
          an absolute scale, and you can all (in theory) receive A+ grades! (Though, we might need to make 
          small bin adjustments if the GPA of the class is below the department suggested range, so we might 
          adjust your score up, but it’ll never be adjusted down).

    subsections:
      - header: Flexibility and Community
        body: Online classes taught during a time of wildfires, power outages, and a worldwide pandemic 
              need to have policies that support students in different living situations, and in different 
              time zones. They need to have a way that the students can get to know each other, learn from 
              each other, and study with each other. They need to have a way the course staff can get to know 
              their students, and (most importantly) check in with them to make sure their health and learning 
              is going ok. The deadlines need to have flexibility in case a student or team needs some more time 
              to finish a project or homework. We believe we have built all of that into our class this semester.

      - header: Synchronous and Asynchronous Learning
        body: Research (and anecdotal evidence) have shown that students who keep up with the material every week 
              do better than students who fall behind, start projects late, and have to cram for each exam at the last 
              minute. So, as much as you can, attend our face-to-face live session (Mon @ 10am PST … but Wed when Monday 
              is a holiday) + a discussion (5 different times) synchronously. However, you will not be penalized for being 
              in a time zone that makes that difficult, and you will find recordings of these sessions available. The only 
              required synchronous element is a weekly 15m check-in with you and three other students with video on (with 
              exceptions on a student-by-student basis), but will have many times throughout the day available for that.

sections:
  - label: Lecture
    synchronous: no
    platform: PrairieLearn
    body: Lecture content has been pre-recorded with high production value. There will be questions to answer via PrairieLearn
          after every lecture, for which you will earn credit. On Mondays at 11 AM, there will be a live weekly summary lecture
          --all content will be the same as in the recordings, but in less depth. You are required to watch the recording and 
          encouraged (but not required) to attend the live sessions. If Monday is a holiday, the live session will be Wednesday. 
          The live session wil also be recorded.
  
  - label: Lab
    synchronous: yes
    platform: Discord
    body: We will have three labs scheduled through the day to be sensitive to differences in time zones. Lab occurs twice a week.
          Lab attendance is encouraged and will be counted towards extra credit, but is not mandatory. Checkoffs either happen 
          in lab or via a Google Form submission. Note that you are graded on completion.
  
  - label: Discussion
    synchronous: yes
    platform: Zoom
    body: Discussion content will be pre-recorded. However, we will also have three live discussion sections, scheduled throughout 
          the day. Discussion attendance is encouraged and will be counted towards extra credit, but is not mandatory. Discussion 
          are typically worksheet based, but turning in the worksheet is not required.

  - label: Check-ins
    synchronous: yes
    platform: Zoom
    body: Once a week, mandatory fifteen-minute synchronous group check-ins will be scheduled throughout the day to be sensitive 
          to differences in time zones. Students will earn credit for attending.
