responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - San Jose, California! Both of my parents are proud Cal alumni, so I’ve naturally been yelling "GO BEARS" my entire life. I actually spent about a week committed to UW before I got off of the waitlist at Cal, and now I’m here!

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - While I tried a little coding in high school, I'd say that my programming experience really started when I took CS10 the spring semester of my freshman year. Besides Snap! and Python, I have some experience with Scheme and SQL and am now learning Java.

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - I love dancing and listening to music.

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - I’d like to say that I’m pretty fluent in Pig Latin.

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - I’ve been filming one second of my day every day for the past four years! I also almost got run over by a red Tesla reversing down Durant my freshman year.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - I’m taking Data 100, CS 61B, Global Studies 10A, and Theater 40. I’m also a member of the sweet organization that is Camp Kesem Berkeley and currently serve on the executive board of my sorority!
