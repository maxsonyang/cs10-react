responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I grew up in New York (on Long Island). I hate cold weather though, so here I am.

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - CS10 was my first programming class the Spring of my Freshman year. So after Snap! and Python, I've also learned Java, C, Swift, Go, SQL, and Scheme.

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - I play some videogames like League of Legends (I'm bad), work out pretty much every day, but my main hobby is just hanging out with friends. As long as I'm doing that we're gucci.

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - I can do a wide range of impressions from movies/daily life, I can juggle, I'm color blind so I see the world differently, and I make the best scrambled eggs you will ever eat.

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - Burke sounds like Berkeley so I'd say that's a success.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - Classes, teaching, applying for jobs, and being a second semester senior.
