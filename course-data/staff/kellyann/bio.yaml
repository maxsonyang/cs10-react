responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I grew up in Sunnyvale (it's in the South Bay). I didn't really know what I was doing college-wise except that I felt like I should go to college, so I did. I started out an intended biology/pre-med major, but after taking CS10 and the introductory technical theater class, I'm a CS and theater management major now. 

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - I have a middling amount of ability in all the languages taught in the introductory classes (Python, Java, C, SQL, Scheme). I also can code in Go if I really have to. And, of course, I know Snap!

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - Dance! In terms of other hobby-ish activities, I write, but since that's neither relaxing nor casual, I don't tend to count it as a hobby. Oh, I do also keep plants -- right now I have a spider plant named Octavia Solioquy Curveball Mortimer (courtesey of me asking friends for plant names and refusing to pick just one) and seventeen green onions.

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - I'm pretty good at eating an entire bag of chips without really thinking about it. I can also make a really delicious spreadsheet!

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - Yeah, we all just experienced 2020 (hehe). My new goal is to live as uninterestingly as possible. Oh! I guess the most recent memorable thing that happened is I managed to schedule a Zoom with four friends I haven't spoken to since high school within the week, and then the conversation went well! That was really cool.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - Mm, I'm taking classes - Databases, Sound Design, History of Celebrity, and something else that hasn't been determined at the point of writing this. Otherwise, I'll be editing a piece of writing that will eventually be published by a baby academic journal out of an East Coast school. I'll also be wrangling performers as part of my management work for a remotely choreographed dance film with the Berkeley dance department!
