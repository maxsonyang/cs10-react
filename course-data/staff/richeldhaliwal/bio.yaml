  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I was born in Reno, Nevada and lived there until I moved to Sacramento, CA around 7 years ago. I have always been interested in engineering and of course applied to Cal because its top ranked for engineering. Also I really just fell in love with the atmosphere of Cal. Specifically how a lot of students aren't afraid to raise their voice or protest for what they believe in. 

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - I had never been exposed to programming prior to taking CS10 last semester. Being an EECS major with no priot experience was definitely scary but CS10 has helped me become much more confident. I currently only know Snap!, and Python, but I am excited to learn more languages over the next few years.

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - Hanging out with my dog, binge watching netflix shows, playing video games, cooking, and baking.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - Along with being an AI for CS10 I will be taking CS61A, EECS16A, and Math 1B. I'm also a part of an organization called Matriculate which helps low income, high acheiving college students through the college application process.
