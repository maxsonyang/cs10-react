Hi there!

To help students get to know you + make setting up the website easier,
you just need to do a couple of things to fill out your bio.

1. Pick a photo you like in .png format, and add it to this folder with the name "profile_pic".

2. Fill out the bio.yaml file with your responses. Not all the fields are required so fill it out
however you'd like. However. you should provide a name, email, and role at a bare minimum.

3. Rename the file with your first/preferred name.

Once you're done, zip the file and send it to the head TA! It'll be ready to plug into the website.

Notes about filling out the YAML file:

1. Delete the "Prompt 'x' response", but keep the dash.
2. you MUST surround the response in quotations if you have any colons.
3. don't rename your bio
4. DELETE the readme when you're done filling out everything
5. Rename your folder firstnamelastname BEFORE zipping
