Hi there!

To help students get to know you + make setting up the website easier, you just need to do a couple of things to fill out your bio.

It is very important you follow these instructions exactly, otherwise your bio may not end up on the website in the format you'd like.

1. Pick a photo you like in .png format (*not* .heic or .jpg), and add it to this folder with the name "profile_pic".

2. Fill out the bio.yaml file with your responses. Delete the "~" for questions you are answering. Not all the fields are required, so those you'd like to leave blank should have a "~" (without quotes). However. you should provide a name, email, and role at a bare minimum.

Notes about filling out the YAML file:

a) Keep the file named as 'bio.yaml', or else it will break :(
b) You MUST surround the response in quotations if you have any colons.
c) Do not put line breaks in your answers
d) DELETE the readme when you're done filling out everything

3. Rename your folder firstnamelastname (no upper case) before zipping

Once you're done, zip the folder and upload it to this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/174A5kzgpS8QNhsWVWO--2mkWm7yt3RyH?usp=sharing ! It'll be ready to plug into the website.

Common errors:
- Providing a profile pic in a format that is not .png
- Renaming profile_pic.png to yourname.png
- Inserting line breaks in bio answers
- Not putting quotations around answers with colons in them
- Accidentally renaming the bio.yaml to yourname.yaml
- Not renaming the folder before zipping
