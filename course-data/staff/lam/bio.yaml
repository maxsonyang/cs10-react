responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I grew up in SoCal in a small city called Rosemead. I knew I wanted to go to school in California and decided to come to Cal because the cost of attendance was the lowest. Turns out there was an error in my package, and this wasn't really the case. I regret nothing.

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - Prior to Berkeley I had zero programming knowledge, but thanks to CS10 I quickly learned Snap! and Python. Afterwards I learned Java, a bit of C and JavaScript. 

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - I enjoy watching movies, TV shows and Youtube, all of which greatly amplified by approaching deadlines.

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - When I work on something I find interesting I enter a state of immense focus, allowing me to work nonstop at the expense of overrated things like health. I think my body switches to photosynthesis also.

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - Stumbling upon CS10, falling in love with CS, and subsequently being able to give back to this wonderful community is an experience I will cheerish many years down the road.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - I'll be taking classes, trying to be helpful, and least importantly continuing the decade-long endeavor to fix my sleeping schedule.
