  - I grew up in Manhattan Beach, California (LA County). I went to Mira Costa High School where I focused my activities on scientific research, until I realized it wasn't for me. I came to Cal last Fall and have already been able to delve into so many different fields in depth that I wasn't able to in high school, CS being one of them.

  - I learned Java when I was younger, and learned Python through CS10. In high school, the computer science courses at my school used AppLab, which is in JavaScript.
