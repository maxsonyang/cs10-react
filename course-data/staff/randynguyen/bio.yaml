responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I'm from Orange County, SoCal and didn't really know what I wanted to do after high school.
    After looking up "what degree do I need to work on video games?" 
    which led me to applying to Cal as a CS major (with 0 hopes of getting in)-
    well, here I am!

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - So far, I've taken CS10 and am currently in CS61A hoping to declare
    as a CS major! This is still my first year of programming, but I'm able 
    to use Snap! & Python, and I can't wait to expand my library of languages. 

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - "In my free time, I love anything games-related! A few ones that I love
    include: Genshin Impact, Apex Legends, osu!, LoL, HS, and Valorant! I 
    also cosplay a little on the side."

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - My work ethic and the trust I place in myself!
    If there's something I want, I'll always do my very best and ultimately 
    never give up. That way, I won't have any regrets!

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - I managed to hit the top 300/2000 of players in LoL! More 
    importantly, my love for games (esp. Genshin) has inspired me to
    one day create a game that makes people all around the world happy.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - Working hard to see if I can make it into CS & on my portfolio, as well as 
    hanging out with friends online every once in a while.
