  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I grew up in Marion, Iowa and definitely never imagined I would be at Cal. I was pretty sure I would end up staying somewhere in the Midwest for college but when I got accepted to Berkeley the opportunity seemed too great to pass up!

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - My first time ever programming was in Snap! In CS10. I have since done Python, Java, C, and some SQL.

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - I started dancing when I was 3 and have loved it ever since. Although I may not be great at it, I love singing, and playing piano and violin. This past winter break I decided to try to learn to play the ukulele, and itâ€™s slowly but surely coming along!
