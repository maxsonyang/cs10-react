responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I grew up in Norcal, in a city called Union City, California. Since my hometown's only a 30 minute drive from Cal, I often visited Berkeley during my childhood, and I ended up falling in love with the city and school. I also actually started out as a Molecular and Cellular Biology major, but ended up (hopefully) switching to Computer Science after taking CS10 last semester!

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - Prior to Cal, I had absolutely zero programming experience. CS10 has helped me build a solid programming foundation, and has taught me Snap! and Python.

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - When I'm not sleeping (rare), I enjoy playing and writing music, drawing (i'm actually a joke of an artist but feel free to follow my ig art account @antbyart), playing video games, and travelling with friends.

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - I've been playing the piano for 9 years, and have been playing percussion for 8 years. I'm also humorously bad at drawing. If you looked at my drawings you'd probably think a little kid drew them.

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - Literally the only thing I remember from my childhood is that in preschool, we had a (for some odd reason) rock pit instead of a sand pit. Little me thought it was a good idea to put a rock up my nose. It got stuck there for a while.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - Other than helping taach CS10 as an AI, I'll be taking CS61A & some breadth courses. I'll also be playing in Cal's Wind Ensemble (virtually).
