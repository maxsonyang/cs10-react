Hi there!

To help students get to know you + make setting up the website easier, you just need to do a couple of things to fill out your bio.

1. Pick a photo you like in .png format, and add it to this folder with the name "profile_pic".

2. Fill out the bio.yaml file with your responses. Not all the fields are required, so those you'd like to leave blank should have a "~". However. you should provide a name, email, and role at a bare minimum. 

Notes about filling out the YAML file:

a) Keep the file named as 'bio.yaml', or else it will break :(
b) You MUST surround the response in quotations if you have any colons.
c) DELETE the readme when you're done filling out everything

3. Rename your folder firstnamelastname

Once you're done, zip the file and upload it to this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/174A5kzgpS8QNhsWVWO--2mkWm7yt3RyH?usp=sharing ! It'll be ready to plug into the website.
