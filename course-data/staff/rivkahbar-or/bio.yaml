responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - "I grew up in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. My path to Cal looked like this: 1) lots of ski slopes 2) starting my own egg-selling business
  at the ripe age of eight (named it 'Mother Clucker') 3) my eggcellent entreprenurship made me the most famous lady in the town
  of J-Hole, thus granting me admission to Cal."

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - I guess a little - pretty sure I aced my last programming class. Are coding and programming the same thing?

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - I love to cook, weld, ski, make pottery, and play tennis.


  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - Recently, I've been really into plants so I guess you could call that a talent (talent because I have only killed 2/5 plants I've owned).

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - I'm an AI for CS10, I'd say that's pretty remarkable.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - The only thing that truly matters to me is coding. Besides that I will be a vegan baker at Berkeley Hillel, attempting to find nirvana via meditation, and preparing myself for Wimbledon.
