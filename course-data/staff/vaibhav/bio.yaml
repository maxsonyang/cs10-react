  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I grew up in Kolkata, a small city in India. I was the first person in my family to want to go to US for further studies and my decision was fully supported by my parents. After tons of rejection letter, I finally got accepted into CAL and made the choice to come here 2 seconds after receiving the letter.

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - I started programming in high school but didn't really enjoy it until CS10 at CAL after which I took 61A and 61B. I am most fluent in Java and Python but also know the very basics of HTML, CSS, JS and C (for resume purposes).

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - Soccer is one of my favorite past times. I love watching soccer (Messi/Barca fan) but more so playing soccer. Apart from that, I also love reading fiction (favorite is Harry Potter) and watching anime!

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - I want to say FIFA but I get the feeling that my roommate would not agree with this even though I beat him like every day. I am also pretty great at sleeping for long periods of time though unfortunately this skill doesn't come in handy often.

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?haircut
  - I have done somethings like getting good grades, getting second rank across the country for a design competition which my parents would claim as remarkable; while some things like going bald on a whim on a hot summer afternoon, getting a cat with my roommates which I would personally consider remarkable.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - I would be working as a Tutor for CS10. Apart from this, I would be enrolled in MATH 110, COMPSCI 70, a R1B and a breadth. Outside of school, I would also be interning at a couple of Skydeck startups which I am so looking forward to!
