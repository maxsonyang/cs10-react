responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - "I grew up in Frisco, Texas a suburb of Dallas— very stereotypical public school vibe. I’ve always wanted to live on the West Coast, but especially California and Cal (especially). I was especially drawn to the history of activism and the Bay Area in general so it was a perfect fit."

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - I had never coded before I came to Cal and didn’t even plan on doing CS until I took CS 10 and got hooked. Since then I've taken more CS courses and feel most comfortable coding in Python or Java.

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - I love being outdoors, so anything in the sun outside is always fun (hiking, swimming, backpacking, etc) and you can never keep me away from museums! I've also been training for a half marathon, so lots of running through the hills of Berkeley. My other hobbies are movies, art (especially harlem renaissance, fauvism, and post-impressionism), basketball, and travelling.
