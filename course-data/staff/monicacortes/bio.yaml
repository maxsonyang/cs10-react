responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I'm from Victorville, CA, a SoCal city no one visits unless they're going to Vegas (since it's on the way there). I hadn't been considering Berkeley as a choice until junior year, so I was very surprised and happy to have made it in. :)

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - I'm currently learning Python, with a little bit of HTML/CSS squeezed in. And of course Snap!

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - I'm into baking and anything artsy/design-related (calligraphy/hand lettering, graphic design, etc).

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - I stopped playing a few years ago, but I could easily pick up playing the violin again.

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - My fastest mile time was around 6 minutes, and I was the first girl to make it in a 50ish person race I had at school :D

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - Besides my classes and being an AI for CS10, I will probably be desiging pages for the school yearbook (yes, it exists)!
