responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I was born and raised in Santa Monica, CA. Growing up, I always thought that I would stay in the LA area for college, but after visiting Cal I knew that this was the school for me.

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - Prior to CS10, I knew close to nothing when it came to programming. Since learning Snap!, I have learned Python, Java, SQL, and a bit of C.

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - I am a HUGE soccer fanatic (Come on you Gunners!) and love everything to do with the sport. I also enjoy playing tennis, watching basketball, travelling with my family, and trying new restaurants.

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - I can resist everything except temptation.

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - I have travelled to nearly 25 different countries which is something most people my age haven't done. I also once got sick while eating at what was rated as the best restaurant in the world (No, it wasn't because of the food - I wasn't feeling well before that moment).

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - ~
