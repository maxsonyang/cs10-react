responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I moved to a different state every 4 years or so, but spent most of high school in a small town in Oregon. I knew I wanted to go to a school that would teach me to make a difference in the world, so when I visited Cal I knew this was the school for me!

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - I didn't know any code before I came to Berkeley and my first experience began in CS10. I loved this class and it inspired me to continue learning about programming/computer science. I now know Snap!, python, java, scheme, and SQL.

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - I am an avid reader and lover of all things related to film/television. I also enjoy making music, exercising, and exploring the outdoors.

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - I can play many instruments! So far, I play piano, trumpet, and ukulele, but would love to learn guitar soon. 

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - My high school rock band has an album on Spotify! We're called Riptyde, check us out!!

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - Besides being an AI for CS10, I'll also be joining the Cognitive Science Student Association (CSSA) and continuing my work in the ASUC. In any free time I'll be working on fun, self-guided coding projects or binging some new shows on Netflix.
