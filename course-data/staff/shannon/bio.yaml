responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I grew up in a small suburb called Palos Verdes about an hour southwest of Los Angeles, CA. My senior year, I applied to all the UCs hoping to get lucky and be accepted to at least one of them. Getting into Berkeley was honestly a huge shock, but since then I haven’t looked back!

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - I started programming my freshman fall at Cal (CS10 woooo!!!). Since then, I have learned MATLAB, Python, SQL, Java, and C. CS10 inspired me to pursue EECS as a major even with the limited background that I had :)

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - I like to dance (ask me about The [M]ovement!), listen to music, talk about how much I love CS10, and bake/make desserts!

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - I know the names of all 50 states in alphabetical order (useful, I know). I’m also very good at finishing full shows on Netflix (Criminal Minds, Bates Motel, etc.), and would like to consider myself a Disney connoisseur.

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - I won a competition of who could stand on one foot and say the alphabet backwards the fastest my freshman year at Cal.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - In addition to being a TA for CS10, I will also be tutoring at Cal's Center for Access to Engineering Excellence (tutoring for CS10 too!), doing research with Dan, and dancing.
