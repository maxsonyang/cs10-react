  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I was born in India, grew up in the UK (and am a British citizen), and graduated from high school in South Africa. UC Berkeley was one of the only universities I considered in the U.S. and I'm so glad I applied! I ended up picking Berkeley because I enjoy the breadth of the education, the specific programs and pathways available, and the opportunity to experience a new place.

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - "I had some basic experience with programming (think 'Hello World') and a shallow understanding of OOP before coming to Cal. CS10 helped me delve into the practical side of problem-solving and programming so I became more confident in my abilities and understanding of many foundational topics. I have also taken CS61A and Data 8 during my time at Cal."

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - "I enjoy cookies (baking them and eating them), listening to music (either one song on repeat or everything on shuffle: chaotic evil ftw), watching Claire Saffitz work through recipes from her new book, sleeping at odd hours, attempting to play the guitar but doing so rather poorly, rewatching films I've seen about a dozen times, and spending time with people I love. Oh, and writing and editing and photography and design."

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - Overthinking, consuming a large amount of chocolate in a short period of time, being fairly mediocre at ice skating, and writing papers under immense stress and limited time.

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - I have lived on five continents in my lifetime. Not that I actively did anything for that. Existed, I guess.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - "I will be taking a full courseload of classes remotely from the U.K. where I'm staying with my parents, leading a writing/creative club for womxn at Berkeley, contributing to other organizations I'm part of such as the Daily Cal and Caravan Travel Magazine, working as a Reader for CS10, trying to be awake for at least a couple hours of sunlight a day while maintaining my schedule largely according to the Pacific timezone, and my most important commitment of all: spending time with my dog."
