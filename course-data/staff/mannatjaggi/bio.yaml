responses:
  # Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?
  - I was born and raised in Oakland, CA which is about a 15 drive from campus. I guess you could say that my path to Cal was a drive away haha.

  # How much programming have you done? Which Languages?
  - I did a bit of coding in high school where I was introduced to a couple languages such as python, java, html, and css. The sad part about it is that I forgot most of what I learned back then. Most of what I know now (namely python and snap) is entirely because of taking CS10 last semester.

  # What are your Hobbies?
  - My hobbies include cooking(!!!), watching anime & kdramas, and honestly, watching food videos on youtube.

  # What are some of your talents and skills?
  - Sleeping and not being able to be wake up to 10+ alarms is one of my talents.

  # Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?
  - I almost drowned when I was really little so I have a certain disliking for swimming especially in deep water. The twist here however is that I somehow managed to convince myself to go snorkeling/manta ray watching when vacationing in Hawaii. Needless to say, I don't regret my decision.

  # What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?
  - ~
