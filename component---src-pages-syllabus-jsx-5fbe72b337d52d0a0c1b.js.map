Academic integrity \n                    and ethical conduct are of utmost importance in the College of Engineering and at UC Berkeley, \n                    especially with online offerings. We want to remind you that this course is graded on an \n                    absolute scale – that means that there will be no curve at the end of the course, so you don’t \n                    have to feel the pressure of having to cheat to get your A. You’re competing against an absolute \n                    scale, and you can all (in theory) receive A+ grades! (Though, we might need to make small bin \n                    adjustments if the GPA of the class is below the department suggested range, so we might adjust \n                    your score up, but it’ll never be adjusted down).\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"syllabus-subsection\">\n                    <div className=\"header\">\n                        Flexibility and Community\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"body\">\n                            Online classes taught during a time of wildfires, power outages, and a worldwide pandemic need to \n                            have policies that support students in different living situations, and in different time zones. \n                            They need to have a way that the students can get to know each other, learn from each other, and \n                            study with each other. They need to have a way the course staff can get to know their students, \n                            and (most importantly) check in with them to make sure their health and learning is going ok. The \n                            deadlines need to have flexibility in case a student or team needs some more time to finish a project \n                            or homework.
