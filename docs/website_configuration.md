# Configuring the Website

The website's designed in a way where you can configure the data (links & other things being displayed),
as well as most of the UI so you can avoid having to modify the actual html/sass/js (for the most part). You can
follow these steps to get the website going.

## Setting up the website

1. [Set up course data](configuring/course-data-config.md)
2. [Set up the UI](configuring/ui-config.md)
